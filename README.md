# Title 
Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?
Venmo
* When was the company incorporated?
Initial release was 2009
* Who are the founders of the company?
Iqram Magdon-Ismail and Andrew Kortina
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The Duo saw inefficiencies in the outdated Point-of-Sales software.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
They raised 1.2 million USD in seed money through financing and was later acquired by Braintree a payments company. Which subsequently was bought out by Paypal for 800 million USD

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Digital Lending and payments
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Primarily tech savvy millennials and Gen X’ers. As they’re the largest user base who know of online banking services and most likely to have smartphones. 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Paying or lending money without the need of a physical dollar bill. Simplicity in the UI design also takes over a share of traditional banking. The virtual ledger makes it especially tempting as it has slowly implemented cryptocurrencies as well.
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
They use ACH or automatic clearing house to do financial banking. Meaning they interact directly with banks instead of using APIs. 

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Digital lending and payments
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years? Usage of online payments through mobile apps.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
It has had over 200 billion USD in payment volume in 2021, approx. 20% of PayPal’s total.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Users, Valuation, and payment volume. Currently they’ve expanded with roughly 70 million annual users, a 38 billion dollar valuation as of 2020, and 200 billion USD in payment volume

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? It’s largest competitor at the moment is Square and Zelle but with Apple Pay entering the market I imagine this will be their largest competition in the future.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 
Offer transactions beyond national lines. Open services for more business operations as they are mostly just for personal use. With the maximum cap being 6,999.99 USD, severely limiting the amount of funds that can be transferred.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Many would switch over to using Venmo as their primary banking and dominate not only the emerging FinTech field but banking as well.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Presumably expanding their ACH or possibly leaning more heavily into crypto-trading with addition of blockchain technology.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
New generation of consumers who are generally distrustful of FIAT currency, with the added marketing potential to say a blockchain virtual ledger is more secure.
